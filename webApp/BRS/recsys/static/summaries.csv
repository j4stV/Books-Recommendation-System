The methods provided in this text, unchanged since 1994 reflect that the authors learned to write research papers in the era of card files and typewriters. Even advanced high school students have probably written enough by the time they encounter this book that they'll have to unlearn a lot of valuable skills to employ the method contained here. In 1995 it was a little dated for the average student, and very dated for the tech savvy (me). In 2009, it is potentially harmful."",

""This is a terrible book. What little it does tell you, it repeats over and over and over and over... The tiny amount of information to be gleaned from this amateur attempt at insight into female sexuality could have been paraphrased in three sentences. 1) Don't be afraid of asking for what you want. 2) Sex is better when the woman has orgasmed first and 3) You deserve it! Get a life women and figure it out on your own.""
],
""pros"": [
""This book lets women know the facts about orgasm. Intercourse is not the only way people have sex, but merely one of the many wonderful options. I have a teen and will make sure that she reads this book someday. Changing the way we look at sex will save many relationships. Great job! I hope to see more books and TV or radio appearances. Attention men: Read this book, you will not be sorry.
Excellent book. This book contains information not easily accessible and what most people do not want to discuss, even the family physician. If young women read this book before starting on their sexual journey it would prevent a lot of ignorance and pain, and if the advice is followed, bring them much pleasure. The author is supposed to be bringing out a book on sex for teens - I would love to hear when it will be out.
My sister made me buy this book (well, actually, she thought I should get one of those technique manuals but this one appealed to me more) when I complained that my sex life was less than exciting . It was probably the most useful book I've ever read in helping me understand and enjoy myself better. As a bonus, my husband (voluntarily) read the book and said that it opened his eyes to things that he had never thought of before and that I had been having a hard time articulating. I would highly recommend this book for couples since, let's face it, good sex really isn't something that comes naturally, especially in Western society-- there's always something to learn. The Douglass sisters are plain-spoken, straightforward and sensitive in their approach and make a good case for rearranging the way we look at sexual relationships.
When I first heard about this book, I thought-- Don't women already know this stuff? I read it at the suggestion of a friend and discovered that there was plenty I didn't know. That, for example, doctors and anatomists don't agree on the shape and size of the clitoris. I'd suggest that every woman read it, even if they start out a bit skeptical, like me.
When I read this book I wanted to cry because there were so many things I was never told about my own sexuality... I read every magazine article on orgasms but nothing helped me until I read this book!! I think both partners in a relationship should read this and understand what these two women are teaching. The best thing about this book was that it didn't 'talk down' to the reader - it really was made for intelligent women who have been mislead about what it takes for a woman to be truly satisfied - both with herself and her partner.
The authors have a refreshing collective voice, and it's so great to finally be encouraged, rather than be told the usual statistic, 'only 30% of women have orgasms-- you should just be content as you are.' I am so thankful that I found this book by chance; I'm buying copies for friends already.
I found that this book spoke to me as a woman - gave me a clear understanding of myself, body and most importantly my sexuality - which for a 35 year old - is VERY important. The Douglass's presented the subject in such an accepting, warm and open manner. I loved it :-) - have recomended it to many friends and they have said the same!!!
The strength of this book is its sociological perspective. This isn't just a recipe book. Marshall McLuhan once said, 'I don't know who it was that discovered water, but it certainly wasn't a fish.' The Douglasses have stepped outside their world to look back at what our expectations are and how the male perspective has shaped them. Fortunately, we may leave the male perspective in its fish bowl and adventure into a world free of patriarchal dicta. Brava, mujeres, y muchas gracias!"",
